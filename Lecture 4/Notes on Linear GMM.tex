\textbf{Note of Linear GMM}\\

We warm up by stating two simple propositions of derivatives with Matrix algebra: \\
(1) For vector $x$, $\frac{\partial A'x}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial x'A}{\partial x}= A' $\\
(2). If $A$ is not a function of $x$ and $A$ is symmetric, then $\frac{\partial x' A x}{\partial x} = 2 x' A $.\\

Now we visit our linear GMM objective function, which is $(Z'Y)'W(Z'Y) + b'(Z'X)'W(Z'X)b - (Z'Y)'W(Z'X)b-b'(Z'X)'W(Z'Y)$.\\

Apply propositions (1) and (2), we have the first order condition as
\begin{eqnarray*}
2b'[(Z'X)'W(Z'X)] - 2[(Z'Y)'W(Z'X)]=0
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus $b'= [(Z'X)'W(Z'X)]^{-1}[(Z'Y)'W(Z'X)]$, which implies that $b^{*} =  [(Z'X)'W(Z'X)]^{-1}[(Z'X)'W(Z'Y)]$
